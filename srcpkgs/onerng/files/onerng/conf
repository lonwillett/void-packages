#	cmd0	- Avalanche noise with whitener (default)
#	cmd1	- Raw avalanche noise
#	cmd2	- Avalanche noise and RF noise with whitener
#	cmd3	- Raw avalanche noise and RF noise
#	cmd4	- No noise

#	set ONERNG_URANDOM_RESEED to the rate at which /dev/urandom is

#	measured in seconds - "0" means continually top it up, empty
#	means don't change.
#	NB: Currently, this rate does not get reset to its original
#	value when the OneRNG service is stopped.  If this is a problem
#	for you, then you may wish to set it to the empty string, or
#	make other arrangements for restoring it.
